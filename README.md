# Python Keylogger for Mac/Linux
 
 This is the home of my custom "Keylogger" it was made for macOS but us also compatible with Linux.
The goal if this project is to make a keylogger user friendly!


Most of the time, keyloggers are associated with "Big bad Hackers" but I want them to become a common security measure for your computer to use while you are away, or just to keep secure.


This keylogger is made to be SUPER easy to use! One of my goals for this project, is to make the KeyLogger itself a executable file, (all you have to do is click the file and there you got it, a KeyLogger!
