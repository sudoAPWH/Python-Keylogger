# Python Keylogger for Mac/Linux
 
 Welcome to the Keylogger Project – a user-friendly keylogger designed primarily for macOS, with compatibility for Linux systems as well. This project aims to make keylogging straightforward and accessible for security-minded users who want to monitor activity on their computers.

Project Purpose
Keyloggers are often associated with malicious intent, but this keylogger is different. Our goal is to create a tool that enhances your computer's security and keeps you informed about what happens when you’re away. Whether you’re using it as a monitoring tool or a security measure, this keylogger prioritizes ease of use.

Key Features
User-Friendly Design: Built with accessibility in mind, this keylogger is as easy to use as possible – limited complex setup or configuration required.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works on both macOS and Linux, ensuring wide support across Unix-based systems.
Plug-and-Play Functionality: Simply run the keylogger executable file, and you're ready to go. (An executable package format is in the works, allowing easy, one-click setup).

Future Goals
One of our primary development goals is to package the keylogger in a convenient executable format, so users can simply download, click, and start using it right away – no installation hassles or configuration steps required!
