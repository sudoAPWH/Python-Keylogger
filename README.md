# Python Keylogger for Mac/Linux
 
 This is the home of my custom "Keylogger" it was made for macOS but us also compatible with Linux.
The goal if this project is to make a keylogger user friendly!


Most of the time, keyloggers are associated with "Big bad Hackers" but I want them to become a common security measure for your computer to use while you are away, or just to keep secure.
