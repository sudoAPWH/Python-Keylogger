# Python Keylogger for Mac/Linux
 
 This is the home of my custom "Keylogger" it was made for macOS but us also compatible with Linux.
The goal if this project is to make a keylogger user friendly!


Keyloggers are mostly associated as "Bad"

But this keylogger, will become a common security measure for your computer to use while you are away, or just to keep secure.


And is made to be SUPER easy to use! One of my goals for this project, is to make the KeyLogger itself a package containing an executable file, (all you have to do is click the .exe file and there you got it, a KeyLogger!
