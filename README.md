# Python Keylogger for Mac (BETA Version 0.1)
 
 Welcome to the Keylogger Project – a user-friendly keylogger designed primarily for macOS, can be edited for Linux systems as well. This project aims to make keylogging straightforward and accessible for security-minded users who want to monitor activity on their computers.

Project Purpose
Keyloggers are often associated with malicious intent, but this keylogger is different. Our goal is to create a tool that enhances your computer's security and keeps you informed about what happened when you were  away. 

Key Features
User-Friendly Design: Built with accessibility in mind, this keylogger is as easy to use as possible – limited complex setup or configuration required.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works on both macOS and Linux, ensuring wide support across Unix-based systems. (May require additional setup if using Linux) 

Plug-and-Play Functionality: Simply run the keylogger .command file, and you're ready to go. 



Instructions to Run the Keylogger Project Using the .command file

Step 1, MACOS install, In your terminal, run 

"git clone https://github.com/sudoAPWH/Python-Keylogger.git t && cd keylogger && chmod +x install_and_run.command keylogger.py"

Step 2, find the cloned directory, click the .command file, and there! you are set up! You should find the logged key strokes in a .txt file in the directory.

Note: this program will NOT run in the backround, I suggest you minimise the window to make it not show on your desktop. 

Also, when you clone the repo, it should put the files in your home directory. If the files are not in your home directory, you will have to move them there. The script is made to get the files from there, if they are not there, THE SCRIPT WILL NOT RUN!
