# Python Keylogger for Mac/Linux
 
 Welcome to the Keylogger Project – a user-friendly keylogger designed primarily for macOS, with compatibility for Linux systems as well. This project aims to make keylogging straightforward and accessible for security-minded users who want to monitor activity on their computers.

Project Purpose
Keyloggers are often associated with malicious intent, but this keylogger is different. Our goal is to create a tool that enhances your computer's security and keeps you informed about what happens when you’re away. Whether you’re using it as a monitoring tool or a security measure, this keylogger prioritizes ease of use.

Key Features
User-Friendly Design: Built with accessibility in mind, this keylogger is as easy to use as possible – limited complex setup or configuration required.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works on both macOS and Linux, ensuring wide support across Unix-based systems.
Plug-and-Play Functionality: Simply run the keylogger .command file, and you're ready to go. 



Instructions to Run the Keylogger Project Using the .command file

Step 1, In your terminal, run 

git clone https://github.com/sudoAPWH/Python-Keylogger.git t && cd keylogger && chmod +x install_and_run.command keylogger.py

Step 2, find the cloned directory, click the .command file, and there! you are set up! You should find the logged key strokes in a .txt file in the directory.

Note: this program will NOT run in the backround, I suggest you minimise the window to make it not show on your desktop.
